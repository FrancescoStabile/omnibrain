Generate a morning briefing for the user.

You have access to:
1. Emails received since last briefing
2. Today's calendar events
3. Pending proposals from yesterday
4. Active project context

Structure the briefing as:
1. **Headline** — The single most important thing (1 line)
2. **Urgent** — Things that need attention NOW (max 3)
3. **Today's Schedule** — Timeline with prep notes
4. **Proposals** — What you've prepared (drafts, briefs, etc.)
5. **FYI** — Non-urgent but notable items

Rules:
- Be concise. The user reads this while drinking coffee.
- Bold the important parts.
- Include specific numbers (34 emails, 3 urgent, 2 meetings).
- End with estimated time needed: "About 45 minutes of focused work today."
