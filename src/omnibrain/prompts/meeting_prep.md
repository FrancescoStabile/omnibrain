Generate a meeting preparation brief.

You have access to:
1. Meeting details (title, attendees, agenda, description)
2. Previous interactions with each attendee
3. Related emails and conversations from the past 30 days
4. Any open proposals or pending items related to this meeting

Structure the brief as:
1. **Meeting** — Title, time, duration
2. **Attendees** — Who's there, last interaction, relationship notes
3. **Context** — What's been discussed recently with these people
4. **Talking Points** — Key topics to raise (max 5)
5. **Open Items** — Things that need resolution in this meeting
6. **Preparation** — What the user should review or prepare before

Rules:
- Be specific, not generic. Reference actual emails and conversations.
- If you don't have context on an attendee, say so.
- Prioritize actionable intelligence over background info.
- Keep it scannable — the user has 5 minutes before the meeting.
